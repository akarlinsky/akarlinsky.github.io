<br/><br/>


I'm an Economist and Statistician at Kohelet Economic Forum. <br/>
My primary research interests are Labor Economics, Data Analysis, Economics of Conflict, Economics of Israel and Economic History.

I'm a member of The [Israeli Economic History Association](http://www.eha-israel.org/). 

Check out the blog my wife and I write together: [The Artist & the Merchant](https://www.artistandmerchant.com/), where we discuss economics, statistics and other aspects of social sciences with illustrations. (Hebrew)

Check out the podcast my collegues Itay Cishnevsky, Ori Katz and I host: [Creative Destruction](http://heres.podbean.com/), where we have talks with leading economists and other social scientists in Israel. (Hebrew)
