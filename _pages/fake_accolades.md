Fake Accolades
======
The following is a list of (fake) praise and accolades I got from various junk journals and conferences. 
This list is useful and funny/sad because: 
(1) These journals usually have nothing to do with my research areas, so are clearly not even trying
(2) They are obviously predatory; (3) You should believe in yourself as much as predatory journals (fake) believe in you.
