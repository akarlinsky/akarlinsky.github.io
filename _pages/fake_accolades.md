# Fake Accolades

The following is a list of (fake) praise and accolades I got from various junk journals and conferences. This list is useful and funny/sad because:

1.  These journals usually have nothing to do with my research areas, so are clearly not even trying and are obviously predatory.

2.  You should believe in yourself as much as predatory journals (fake) believe in you!
